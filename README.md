# AI Guardian 🚨
## Real-Time Fall Detection & Emergency Response System

---

## 📌 Project Overview

AI Guardian is a real-time AI surveillance system that detects human falls using computer vision and automatically triggers emergency response workflows. The system integrates detection intelligence, verification logic, location services and automated alerts to reduce response time during emergencies.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Falls are a major cause of injury in:
• Elderly care environments  
• Industrial workplaces  
• Public surveillance areas  

Traditional monitoring requires manual supervision.

AI Guardian solves this by:

✅ Detecting falls automatically  
✅ Reducing false positives  
✅ Alerting emergency contacts  
✅ Providing AI first aid recommendations  
✅ Sharing exact incident location

## 🔄 Core Workflow

Detection Pipeline:
Detection → Verification → Classification → Alert Decision

System Logic:

1️⃣ Person fall detected  
2️⃣ Timer verification starts  
3️⃣ Movement check performed  
4️⃣ If movement → Ignore  
5️⃣ If no movement (10 sec) → Alert triggered  
6️⃣ AI generates recommendations (Firstaid)
7️⃣ Location shared  
8️⃣ If no recovery (60 sec) → Hospital escalation
